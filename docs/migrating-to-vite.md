## Core Vite setup

### Copy [vite.config.ts](../template/vite.config.ts) to your project

### Switch to ESM Syntax

Vite is built on top of ESM Syntax => You should add `"type": "module"` to your package.json to tell Node that all `.js`
files are now using ESM. If you need to have CommonJS-style syntax in some files, you can rename those to `.cjs`.

### Update npm scripts in `package.json`

* Remove `eject` and `analyze` scripts as they are no longer needed.
* Update scripts `start`, `build` and `test` accordingly to use vite:

```
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "test": "jest src",
```

We're not using a dedicated `analyze` script with `source-map-explorer` anymore. Instead, we're utilizing
[rollup-plugin-visualizer](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer). You can see how it's configured in the
[template Vite Config file](../template/vite.config.ts).

### Move the `index.html` out of the public folder into the root

* Adapt the entry point for your index.tsx file to: `<script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx"></script>`.
* Check out [how Vite's public folder works](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) / potentially
  remove the `public` directory if you don't need it.

### Update environment variables

See [the Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) on environment variables.

* Rename `REACT_APP_*`properties to `VITE_*`.
* Update references in code: `process.env.REACT_APP_*` becomes `import.meta.env.VITE_*`, 
  `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` becomes `import.meta.env.DEV`, etc.
* Copy the `.env.development` into a `.env.local` for your local config (_optional, only when you need a dedicated
  local, uncommitted config_).
* Search whether your project uses the `DefinePlugin` from Webpack. Make sure those globally defined values are added
  to the vite config's `define` section (see the `APP_VERSION` value from 
  [the template's vite config](../template/vite.config.ts), for example).

### Remove your old `webpack.config.js` and all related files

## Fix source file names

Files which contain JSX code **must** be properly named `.jsx` or `.tsx`. Other build systems maybe didn't care about
this too much, but Vite / esbuild will not work when JSX code is in a file that has just a `.js` or .`ts` extension.

## Switch to relative-only paths for imports

Some frontend projects heavily rely on import aliases or automatic root imports. This _can_ be done with Vite, as well,
but maybe it's a good idea to go through your application and refactor all imports to use relative paths. This matches
the standardized default of ESM and TypeScript.

```js
// turn imports like this:
import { some, stuff } from '@/utils/blah';

// into this (with the correct amount of ../, of course)
import { some, stuff } from '../../../utils/blah';
```

## Problems with `moment` imports

Moment seems to have weird / broken exports in ESM-land. Directly importing sub-properties `from 'moment'` will not
work. Simply import the whole module and use it in your code:

```js
// before
import { isMoment } from 'moment';

const blah = isMoment(something);

// after
import moment from 'moment';

const blah = moment.isMoment(something);
```
## (optional) Switch to `oidc-client-ts`

The vite.config.ts in this template uses `oidc-client-ts` instead of `oidc-client`. It's a zero-effort drop-in
replacement with better typing. If you don't want to switch, don't forget to update the `manualChunks` entry in your
vite config where `oidc-client-ts` is mentioned.

## Update `history` package dependency

In case you're using react-router v5, you should update the `history` package to at least v5.3.0.

## Recommended: Adapt the project folder structure to the template's folder structure

This will ensure that developers feel right at home when working with your project and other projects.

## Import custom styles

In case you have custom CSS in one or more `.css` or `.less` files, you might need to add the entry to your `index.ts`
by adding a dedicated import:

```js
import 'App.css';
```

## (optional) Add dependencies for local mock

If you're using a local dev server: You might have to install dependencies like `express` and `body-parser` as
devDependencies manually. 

## Fix dev server issues

In case you're facing an error message like *"Request url is outside of Vite serving allow list"*, you might want to
add the following to your vite.config:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
    // ....
    server: {
        // ....
        fs: {
            strict: false,
        },
    },
});
```

Optionally, change default port to your old project settings by editing the `vite.config.ts`and add the server.port:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
    // ....
    server: {
        // ....
        port: 8090,
    },
});
```

# Migrate to Vitest

Vitest is a drop-in replacement for Babel + Jest. It shares / enhances the Vite config.

This allows test code to be compiled significantly faster while having a ton less dependencies!

## Update npm dependencies

```shell
# install vitest
npm i -D vitest vitest-fetch-mock

# remove now-obsolete stuff
npm uninstall @types/jest jest-changed-files jest-environment-jsdom jest-junit
```

## Update npm scripts 

```
"test": "vitest run",
"test-ci": "vitest run --reporter=junit --outputFile.junit=./results/junit.xml",
"test-dev": "vitest",
"coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
```

## Add vitest imports to test files (as needed)

```javascript
import { describe, test, expect, beforeEach, afterEach, vi } from 'vitest';
```

## Migrate from Jest (e.g. for mocking, stubbing)

Follow the [Migrating from Jest](https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html#migrating-from-jest) guide and update your test
code accordingly.

## Update all imports to ESM

```javascript
// OLD:
import ApplicationLayout from '@rio-cloud/rio-uikit/lib/es/ApplicationLayout';

// NEW:
import ApplicationLayout from '@rio-cloud/rio-uikit/ApplicationLayout';
```

## Remove all jest configuration from your `package.json` or dedicated config files

## Integrate Vitest fake timers with React Testing Library

React Testing Library has [some internal support](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/blob/main/src/pure.js#L51) 
for Jest fake timers. Sadly, as of now there is no similar support for the fake timers from Vitest. Without this
support, React Testing Library test cases that use fake timers might just hang and eventually time out.

We can, however, just stub the global `jest.advanceTimersByTime` function during Vitest's setup phase. See
[setupTests.ts](../template/src/__test__/setupTests.ts) for how it's done.
